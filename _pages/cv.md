# Short bio
I come from a beautiful eastern Europe country Moldova, where I finished my license in **software engineering**.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/img/moldova_image.jpg" alt="Orheiul Vechi" caption="My favorite place from Moldova. It's name is 'Orheiul Vechi', in english 'Old Orhei'. A natural and historical complex. It is placed around 50km from the capital of Moldova (Chisinau). I strongly recommend you to visit this place if you are going to visit Moldova.  " %}

In the end, I got experience in developing desktop and web applications. I was very passionate, but I decided to move to France. Here, I obtained a master's degree in Computer Science, that is in **Data mining and exploration EID2**, at University Paris 13 and then a **Ph.D.** in **Statistical Learning** at the University of Toulon. I had different opportunities to gain experience in academic and company environments. Today, I am working on the 11 projects proposed by the Open Classroom course for the **Data Scientist: Artificial Intelligence Engineer** to improve my skills.

My professional interests are in ***artificial intelligence*** üß† : ***machine learning***, ***deep learning*** techniques and their text/Visio/audio applications.

My hobbies are sports (running üèÉÔ∏è, foot, chess), travelüß≥, and movies/series.

On weekends I am the happiest man spending time with my family - my wife and our boys üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶.

You can get my short [CV](/assets/docs/CV_Bartcus.pdf) in a pdf format, or you can consult it in more detail in a digital form on this page.

I am looking forward üëÄ to getting in touch with you and working on some great projects.

# Main Skills as a Data Scientist
- Process structured or unstructured data
- Control data quality, detect patterns, outliers
- Propose and put into practice statistical models (regressions, etc.) or data science (machine learning, etc.) to meet business challenges
- Collaborate with technical and business teams to define needs and explain results
- Present the results (reports, presentations, etc.)
- Develop and industrialize data science algorithms (machine learning, NLP, etc.)

# Technical skills
- Programming Languages. As a software engineer background, many programming languages are studied by me. These are the 3 main languages used in my work as a Data Scientist:
  - Python (is the main programming language I use all the day)
  - Matlab (used during my Ph.D. and Master 2)
  - R (contributed to the developing of an open source R package that is available on [GitHub link](https://github.com/fchamroukhi/MEteorits) )

# Soft Skills

- ***Result Oriented***: I am putting my goals every week so that I archive them. I can use different tools like MindNote, TodoList, Notion to organize my tasks and work. Each experience shows that I archived my goals on time, and never gave back.

- ***Time management***: I like to manage my time and use it as optimally as possible. A google calendar is a great tool to organize and manage your time.

- ***Motivation to learn***: I consider myself very motivated to learn and to gather new skills each day. This skill helped me a lot in passing throw my Ph.D. and then working on different machine-learning projects as a PostDoc. I  stay up to date with state of the art of machine learning technology.

- ***Analytical mind***: I developed this skill as a Ph.D. in Computer Science during all of my previous experiences.

- ***Conversation***: I like interacting with the team and clients we work with.

- ***Empathy***: I like to listen, understand and share the feelings of others.

# Currently occupation

Currently a student at OpenClassroom as an Engineer in Artificial Intelligence. I'm working on 11 projects which carry Data Analysis and Exploration, Data pre-processing, Supervised and Non-supervised modeling, Deep Learning, NLP, Cloud Computing, Visualization, and Model Deployment. [Here](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/188-ingenieur-ia), the full description of this online learning path is available.

***Description:***
Automatic segmentation of 3D lung nodules through deep learning. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Characterization of lung tumors should be done by machine learning using radiomics techniques. Therefore we need to automatically segment the lung nodules in CT images. To segment lung tumors, we use deep learning which gives good results in terms of quality, robustness, and computation time.

September 2018 ‚Äì February 2020

***Description:***
The task was to participate in the creation of a data science platform dedicated to the unsupervised classification of high-dimensional data. The first step concerns prototyping developed algorithms by the members of the project AStERiCs, and their integration into this platform on various real applications. These are unsupervised classification algorithms based on latent variable models. The second step is to integrate the algorithms is developed during the project. A part of the work is carried out in collaboration with the LMNO lab on distributed regularized mixture models with environmental applications / genomic sequences. The main missions are in unsupervised learning models, Prototype unsupervised learning algorithms, High performance distributed cloud computing, and Web integration and interfacing with the platform.

***Description:***
Co-clustering is a data mining technique that aims at identifying the underlying structure between the rows and the columns of a data matrix in the form of homogeneous blocks. It finds many real world applications, however many current co-clustering algorithms are not suited on large size data set. One of the successfully used approach to co-cluster big sized data reaching to millions of instances and tens of thousands of values per dimension is the MODL co-clustering method that optimizes a criterion based on a regularized likelihood. However, difficulties are encountered with up to billions of values per variable. This post-doc focuses on developing a co-clustering algorithm, given the MODL criterion allowing to efficiently deal with very large data sets that does not fit in memory. My work was to co-cluster large scale data sets in a reasonable time by using less RAM memory then the existing co-clustering techniques.

***Description:***
I worked on the two applications that are Humpback whale song structuration and Birds classification. For the humpback structuration was to segment the signal to give different hypothesis of these song. Bayesian non-parametric learning approaches are used to automatically decompose the whale signal and produce song units that are considered as kind of whale alphabet. For the second application the task was to classify the bird songs in an automatic way to identify bird species in some recording. Also in a context when several species are present in a recording, the goal is to find the foreground specie (the one that appears closes to the microphone), this induced to a single label classification problem.

***Description:***
This thesis focuses on statistical learning and multi-dimensional data analysis. It particularly focuses on unsupervised learning of generative models for model-based clustering. We study the Gaussians mixture models, in the context of maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm, as well as in the Bayesian estimation context by maximum a posteriori via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques. We mainly consider the parsimonious mixture models which are based on a spectral decomposition of the covariance matrix and provide a flexible framework particularly for the analysis of high-dimensional data. Then, we investigate non-parametric Bayesian mixtures which are based on general flexible processes such as the Dirichlet process and the Chinese Restaurant Process. This non-parametric model formulation is relevant for both learning the model, as well for dealing with the issue of model selection. We propose new Bayesian non-parametric parsimonious mixtures and derive a MCMC sampling technique where the mixture model and the number of mixture components are simultaneously learned from the data. The selection of the model structure is performed by using Bayes Factors. These models, by their non-parametric and sparse formulation, are useful for the analysis of large data sets when the number of classes is undetermined and increases with the data, and when the dimension is high. The models are validated on simulated data and standard real data sets. Then, they are applied to a real difficult problem of automatic structuring of complex bioacoustic data issued from whale song signals. Finally, we open Markovian perspectives via hierarchical Dirichlet processes hidden Markov models.
