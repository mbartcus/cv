I come from a beautiful eastern Europe country Moldova, where I finished my licence in **software engineering**. By the end, I had an experience in developing desktop and web applications. I liked it very much but I decided to move to France. Here, I obtained a master degree in Computer Science, that is in **Data mining and exploration EID2**, at University Paris 13 and than a **Ph.D** in **Statistical Learning** at University of Toulon. At the end, I had different opportunities to gain experience in academic and company environments. Today, I am working on the 11 projects proposed by the Open Classroom course for the **Data Scientist : Artificial Intelligence Engineer** in order to improve some of my skills.

My professional interests are in ***artificial intelligence*** 🧠 : ***machine learning***, ***deep learning*** techniques and their text/visio/audio applications.

My hobbies are: sport (running 🏃️, foot, chess), travel🧳, movies/series.

In the weekend I am the happiest men spending time with my family - my wife and our boy 👨‍👩‍👦.

Looking forward 👀 to get in touch with you and working on some interesting projects.
