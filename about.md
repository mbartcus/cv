My name is Marius 🤝. Here, you will get to know me better ✊.

I come from a beautiful eastern Europe country Moldova, where I finished my licence in **software engineering**. As result, I worked in developing desktop and web applications, but I decided further to continue with a master degree in Computer Science, that was **Data mining and exploration EID2**, at University Paris 13. At the end of this master degree I had an scientific internship where I discovered the beauty of working with data. The next step of my life was as a **Ph.D** student at University of Toulon at the Information Sciences and Systems Lab, where I worked with my supervisors Faicel Chamroukhi and Hervé Glotin. At the end of the hardest work as a Ph.D, I had different opportunities to work in academic and company environments. Today, I am working on the 11 projects proposed by the Open Classroom course for the Data Scientist : Artificial Intelligence Engineer in order to improve some of my missing skills.

My professional interests are in working with data. I am interested in artificial intelligence 🧠 : machine learning, deep learning techniques and their text/visio/audio applications. My hobbies are: sport (running 🏃️, foot, chess), travel🧳, movies/series. In the weekend I am the happiest men spending time with my family - my wife and our boy 👨‍👩‍👦.

Looking forward 👀 to get in touch with you and working on some interesting projects.
